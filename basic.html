<h2>FLORA IN INDIA</h2>
<p>Indian flora has a great range of varieties from the coniferous to the ever green, from scrubs to deciduous forests and thick tropical jungles to cool temperate woods. The tropical 
forests in east are in contrast to the pine and coniferous woodland of the western Himalayas. The Himalayan foothills are dense with deciduous trees and shrubs, bamboos, fern and grass. 
The gangetic plain, the Deccan plateu of volcanic ancestry, the dense luxuriant forests of the Western Ghats - all provide fascinating variations in habitats.Pine, fir, spruce, cedar, larch 
and cypress are the timber-yielding plants of which several also occur widely in the hilly regions of India</p>
<h3>WHAT IS FAUNA?</h3>
<p>Fauna is a term which refers to all of the animal life within a specified region, time period, or both.Fauna was first used as a biological term by naturalist Carl Linnaeus, as a term 
which described the animals of a region, as opposed to the plants. Plant life was dubbed flora. Thus, the flora and fauna of a region or time describe all of the life within.</p>
